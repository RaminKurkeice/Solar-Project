### Nov 28, 2019
-------------------
Just added my presentation on the git hub documents it is a powerpoint so you must download to access it.  
[Powerpoint](https://github.com/RaminKurkeice/Solar-Project/blob/master/documentation/Solar%20panel%20project.pptx)

### Nov 20, 2019
------------------
pi case has been cut and assembled.  
some problems that i have are that the case is about 5mm to small and the top needs to be extended to fit the full pi.  
here are the pictures as proof.  
[V4Diagram](https://github.com/RaminKurkeice/Solar-Project/blob/master/images/Ramin_PI_Case_V4.pdf)

I will update this when version 5 is cut.

enclosure has been laser cut
